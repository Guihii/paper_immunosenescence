# Menopause is associated with immunosenescence and shifts in immune cell composition, potentially impairing adaptive capacity. Physical exercise may counteract these effects by modulating DNA methylation, particularly in genes linked to cardiorespiratory fitness (VO₂peak). This study aimed to investigate how menopausal status influences estimated immune cell proportions and their relationship with epigenetic responses to exercise. We selected two DNA methylation datasets from whole blood in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE296180 and GSE270856), including pre- and postmenopausal women who completed structured training programs. Cellular composition was estimated using the EpiDISH package, and associations with VO₂peak and exercise adaptation were analyzed using linear models. In the postmenopausal group, we identified 104 CpGs associated with VO₂peak and 61 with training adaptation (FDR < 0.05), alongside cell-type-specific associations for B cells, Natural Killer Cells and Monocytes. Interaction models revealed that VO₂peak-related methylation changes were further modulated by immune cell proportions, particularly in CD4⁺ T cells and monocytes. No significant associations were detected in premenopausal women. These findings suggest that the immune and epigenetic landscapes in postmenopausal women may be more responsive to exercise, potentially due to underlying hormonal and immunological shifts, supporting the development of personalized exercise interventions for aging women
